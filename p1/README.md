## Game planning
+ Initially, Player A and Player B each have an equal number of marbles, from 5 to 10.
+ Player A has to hide some number of marbles in their fist.
+ Player B needs to guess whether Player A has an odd or even number of marbles.
+ Player B receives those marbles from Player A if the guess is correct and vice versa.
+ Successively, Player B will get their turn to play.
+ At the end, whoever has lost all their marbles first is the loser.
+ In the view, report the results - player A's move, player B's move, the winner
