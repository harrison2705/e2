## Game planning
+ Create an empty variable to determine who is the winner of the game.
+ Create an array containing two values "Odd" and "Even".
+ Create arrays containing the guess of Player A and Player B in each round.
+ Create arrays containing the current total number of marbles of each player in each round.
+ Create arrays containing the number of marbles that each player decides to hide in each round.
+ Create an array showing the winner of each round.
+ Randomly choose the number of marbles for each player at the beginning of the game, from 5 to 10.
+ For each round, as long as the number of marbles of each player is larger than 0, execute the loop.
+ In odd rounds, Player A hides marbles, Player B guesses.
+ In even rounds, Player B hides marbles, Player A guesses.
+ The player who hides marbles will randomly choose the number of marbles they want to hide, as long as it is larger than 1.
+ The player who guesses will choose "Odd" or "Even".
+ If the guesser is correct, they will receive the number of marbles the other chose to hide, and vice versa. 
+ Whoever has lost all their marbles first is the loser.
+ The number of marbles of each player cannot be negative, and the maximum number of marbles that the winner can have is double the initial number of marbles assigned to each player.
+ In the view, report the results - Player A's move, Player B's move, and the winner.
